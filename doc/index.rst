Login to your control panel or phpMyadmin to create database user with password and add database to user. Give all access rights to your database user. When you copied all files to your host, access to the #mappiamo root by your browser by http. Setup process will be started. Fill all required fields.

1) Post: this is a simple text based blog content (with marker on the map if required)
2) Place: content for the place selected on the map

About semantic web
------------------

The Semantic Web is an extension of the Web through standards by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). The standards promote common data formats and exchange protocols on the Web, most fundamentally the Resource Description Framework (RDF).

According to the W3C, "The Semantic Web provides a common framework that allows data to be shared and reused across application, enterprise, and community boundaries". The term was coined by Tim Berners-Lee for a web of data that can be processed by machines. While its critics have questioned its feasibility, proponents argue that applications in industry, biology and human sciences research have already proven the validity of the original concept. (wikipedia)

.. note:: Mappiamo automatically support semantic web for better result on google searches by content and meta data. The standard semantic data generated automatically by the content module.

----------------------------------

Semantic data generated by meta data and content. The content editor or administrator can insert metadata when modify saved content step-by-step, but metadata generator form is available on the frame "Use meta data wizzard" on "Meta" tab. Editor can select form theme, and the selected form can be filled and savaed. These forms are folows the standard rules of semantic web data.

.. note:: Always read the rules before fill the metadata generator form. For example, if the content meta assigned to organization, the instrictions can be found here: https://schema.org/Organization. Currently we offer four pre-generated form for automatic metadata creation.
